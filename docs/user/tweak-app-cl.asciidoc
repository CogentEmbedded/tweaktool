== How to start the client application

Client is a REPL console that connects to a tweak server on startup and
maintains the connection during entire lifecycle of this program. If
Tweak server is being disconnected, program tries to restore connection.

== Program arguments

Program is being started with these arguments:

[source, sh]
----
tweak-app-cl [-t connection_type] [-p params] [-u uri]
----

All arguments are optional.

* connection_type: One of "nng", "serial". Type is case-sensitive.
* params: Additional params for backend separated by semicolon ';'. Only
mutually exclusive "role=server" and "role=client" are currently
recognized for IP-based connections.
* uri: Connection URI for the given network backend.

By default connection_type is "nng", params argument is "role=client",
and uri is tcp://0.0.0.0:7777/.

== Operation

* User start the application with arguments described in previous
section.
* Asks user to enter a new value, User enters a new value, it is sent to
the server. No ack is available so nothing is printed on the screen.
* On new value coming from the server it is printed on the screen after
select command was run
* If user wants to enter new value but server connection has dropped/is
down we show a message:
+
Editing disabled, connection dropped.

== Supported commands

[source, sh]
----
list [re][filter]
select [uri]
set [uri] [value]
set [value]
get [uri]
get
load filename
save filename
exit
----

* Spaces in arguments

This program recognizes backslash as an escape char, therefore user might use _select /a b c/d e f_ to access item with an uri /a b c/d e f.

* list

This function is invoked by _list_ command followed by optional pattern.
It displays all items whose uris matches provided pattern. If pattern is
omitted, no filter is applied. User might use POSIX regex be prefixing
filter with re marker, for instance _list re [RWX]/a_ shall match R/a,
W/a and X/a.

* select

Select one item to access it with short _set_ and _get_ commands.

* set

This command sends updated value to a server. Two variants of this
command available: with three arguments and with two arguments. Former
command affects value of an item provided explicitly by uri, latter
affects value of an item previously selected with _select_ command.

* get

This command displays most recent value of an item. Like _set_, it has
two variations: one allowing to pick an item explicitly by its uri and
one that gives value of an item previously selected by _select_ command.
Former one takes a single _uri_ argument, latter doesn't require any
argument at all.

* load

This command allows to run a batch consisting of all commands provided
by this REPL. It has mandatory _filename_ argument.

* save

This command allows to store a dump of the current state of a server as
a sequence of _set_ commands. It has mandatory _filename_ argument.
